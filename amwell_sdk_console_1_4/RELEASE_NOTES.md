    - Additionally the new version of the SDK includes a variety of visual improvements to the video console used within the widget.

- Enhancement (Breaking Change) - The widget now is more granular with the custom css properties for coloring buttons, see the README for more details:
      --amwell-visit-console-button-border-radius
      --amwell-visit-console-video-button-color
      --amwell-visit-console-video-button-color-hover
      --amwell-visit-console-end-visit-button-color
      --amwell-visit-console-end-visit-button-color-hover
      --amwell-visit-console-chat-button-color
      --amwell-visit-console-chat-button-color-hover
